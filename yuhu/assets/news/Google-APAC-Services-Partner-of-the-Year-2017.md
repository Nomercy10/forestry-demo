CloudCover today announced that it has received the 2017 Google Cloud APAC Services Partner of the Year award. This year’s award was presented at the Google Cloud Next Partner Summit, an event that showcases Google Cloud partners spanning G Suite, GCP, Maps, Devices, and Education in San Francisco.

CloudCover was recognized for the company’s achievements in the Google Cloud ecosystem, helping joint customers like BlackBerry Messenger (Emtek), Hike.in & Traveloka migrate to Google Cloud Platform and achieve success in the cloud. A Google Cloud Premier Partner, CloudCover has hundreds of customers around the world and offices in Los Angeles, Singapore and Pune, India. 

Although primarily a services company, at Google Next, CloudCover is launching two of its products: Bolt - a lightning-fast native cloud console for Mac & Windows that supports all three major public clouds and Strato - a monitoring app that combines metrics from popular tools and correlated custom thresholds, turning an entire dashboard into a single blinking light.
